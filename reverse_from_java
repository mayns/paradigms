%Think about the fact that the argument can be passed as a reference or as a value (it is the key of this exercise). If you have to create a cell to represent that, call it I (uppercase i). Note that the local used to declare I is not the same local used to declare Temp.
																																dedeclare
fun {Reverse S}
   local I={NewCell S} in
      local Temp={NewCell nil} in
	 for C in @I do
	    Temp:=C|@Temp
	 end
	 @Temp
      end
   end
end

{Browse {Reverse [1 2 4]}}
