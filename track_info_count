%In this exercise, you will have to track characters in a stream. In order to do that, you have to create a filter (named Counter) that takes a stream of characters as input and returns another stream in which every element is a list of couple "Character"#"Number of time this Character appears".

%For instance, from the stream a|b|a|c|_, the filter Counter produces: [a#1]|[a#1 b#1]|[a#2 b#1]|[a#2 b#1 c#1]|_

%When Counter is created, you have to write (exactly) the following test line:
%        local InS X in X = {Counter InS} InS = a|b|a|c|_ {Delay 2000} {Browse X} end

declare
fun {Counter S}
   local History InnerCounter in
      History = {NewCell nil}
      fun {InnerCounter S1}
	 local Res Met in
	    Res={NewCell nil}
	    Met={NewCell false}
	    case S1 of X|S2 then
	       for E in @History do
		  case E of C#N then
		     if C == X then
			Res:={Append @Res [C#N+1]}
			Met:=true
		     else
			Res:={Append @Res [C#N]}
		     end
		  end
	       end
	       if @Met then skip
	       else
		  Res:={Append @Res [X#1]}
	       end
	       History:=@Res
	       @History|{InnerCounter S2}
	    else nil
	    end
	 end
      end
      thread {InnerCounter S} end
   end
end


local InS X in X = {Counter InS} InS = a|a|a|a|a|nil {Delay 2000} {Browse X} end
